**The repository for my portfolio**

> [!NOTE]
> Currently looking for inspo and thinking very hard about the graphic style i want to use.

Once complete, the portfolio will contain:
- [ ] A quick introduction
- [ ] A showcase with some of my projects
- [ ] A contact form or contact info
- [ ] A lot of filler stuff


Come back later to see if I actually got enough motivation to finish it

Or don't

I don't know you
